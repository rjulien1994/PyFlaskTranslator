# PyFlaskTranslator
Quick little app to help me learn German

This web app is a translator with the option to add and remove queries at will.
This could be useful for someone trying to learn a new language and enter all the words he wishes to learn in the db.

The page include a add and remove word box, the tranlator, a test-yourself minigame and the option to change the origin and target language.

I didn't spend a lot of time on the style of the page as the main purpose was to communicate with a SQL db from the browser for future projects.

The python packages required are numpy, flask, mysql.connector.
You will also have to set up your mysqlServer and create your dictionary database. I use popSQL but you could run the commands thru the server prompt.
